            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>
                We keep track of how often you are using our app in order to best understand your water drinking habits as well
                as how to improve our app features to make your experience better. The only other data we keep track of is the
                information you give us based on how often you are drinking water.
                We also keep track of crash data which allows us to improve bug fixes that will improve your experience using
                the application.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Information Gathering and Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Drink Up! collects anonymous usage information. It also collects general location information for anonymous
                usage (for example, "user in Ontario, Canada added a drink"). We collect this data to find what features you are
                using and what we can improve.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Drink Up! may occasionally update this policy. If you've shared your contact information with us, we'll notify
                you about significant changes to the way we treat your personal information.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Have a comment?</h3>
            <p>
                If you have questions or comments about our privacy policy please fill out the feedback form which can be found
                in-app settings.
