# My Personal Website

## Introduction
This is the source code for my website. Think of it as a prettier resume with links to my email, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nirosh-ratnarajah/), and GitHub of course. The purpose is to help show what I've done in my previous co-ops while in my uWaterloo Computer Engineering program.
